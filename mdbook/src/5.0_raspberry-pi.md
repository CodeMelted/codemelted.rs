# 5.0 Raspberry Pi

<center><img style="max-width: 480px;" src="models/logo-the-planned-trip.png" /></center>

Welcome to the *CodeMelted Raspberry Pi* project. This project will make use of the `codemelted.rs` project to design and build an IoT system that runs on a Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer. It will provide a REST API endpoint to facilitate the capture of picture / videos for sky watching and what is deemed Jeep Adventure.

The Jeep Adventure idea was born out of the idea to travel within a Jeep Wrangler to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. This encompasses roughly a three week round trip journey. The [6.0 Original Prototype](#61-original-prototype) setup Raspberry Pi infotainment system with picture capture capabilities. Further fleshing out of this idea include now adding a sky watching capture capability to compliment the complete system.

## 6.1 Original Prototype

**Highlights:**

- Original prototype was a Python based application.
- The app provided a basic HTML app that displayed / controlled the Raspberry Pi 2 Camera module.
- The original hardware was was a Raspberry Pi 3 Single Board Computer utilizing the Raspberry touch screen.
- This was mounted in a 2005 two door Jeep Wrangler interacting with the installed smart radio.
- It worked but improvements could be made and COVID hit 😢 delaying refinement of the product.

## 6.2 The New Design

The new design will focus on two hardware form factors. The first being a Jeep Wrangler dash cam. The second is as a dedicated sky watcher. The following *Acceptance Criteria* identify what the goals of the new design.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Provides the ability to capture still images every X seconds for Y time storing those images on the local SD card / usb drive.
2. Provide the ability to capture video for X time storing that video on the local SD card / usb drive.
3. Provide the ability to remote control the device to perform the following:
   1. Take still images as specified in AC 1.
   2. Take videos as specified in AC 2.
   3. View a current live video stream.
   4. Get current device health metrics (CPU, hard drive space, GPS, etc.).
   5. Provide ability to manage the device to perform updates and download currently captured images / video.
4. Provide a diagnostic Terminal User Interface (TUI) to provide a local ability to accomplish the tasks identified in AC #3.

**Highlights:**

- Utilizes a Raspberry Pi 4 Single Board Computer. 4 Gb / 8Gb RAM model.
- Utilizes the updated Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3.
- Two form factors will exist for this device. The first as shown in the presentation mountable within the Jeep Wrangler.
- The second form factor as a dedicated [sky watcher](https://spectrum-ieee-org.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/spectrum.ieee.org/amp/all-sky-camera-2661714798?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&usqp=mq331AQGsAEggAID#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=16884733756221&csi=0&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fspectrum.ieee.org%2Fall-sky-camera)
- [6.2.3 Software Models](#623-software-models) will identify the endpoints for the software.
