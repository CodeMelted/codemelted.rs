<h1><img style="height: 35px;" src="https://codemelted.com/assets/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png" /> codemelted.rs: : The Swiss Army Knife Full Stack Solution</h1>

*BY: Mark Shaffer / LAST UPDATED: 2025-Aug-06*

"Write once, run anywhere (WORA)" was the famous slogan made by Sun Microsystems in 1995. At the time, this technology allowed for easy full stack engineering allowing you to target dedicated workstations and on-premises servers. So long as a Java Runtime Environment existed, you could run your code. Java was unable to keep to their slogan as web browsers became more advanced, mobile devices became ubiquitous, and companies no longer required dedicated servers.

As a full stack software engineer, I have had the privilege to work on technologies ranging from mainframes, custom built hardware from the 1980s, communications with satellites in space to data communication over Wide Area Networks. C, C++, and Java were the main drivers for this experience to include some FORTRAN and IBM Assembly 370. Also had the privilege to work on embedded systems utilizing different real-time operating systems as part of this wider communication systems experience.

Then came the secondary part of my career entering the commercial world. My full stack experience needed to evolve as Java was no longer enough. Instead of dedicated backend servers, there are now cloud services and the web made the ultimate application as a service runtime for reaching customers. As long as a device has a browser, the user can reach your app. While professionally my work has been in mobile app development, the technologies I learned along the way has led to learning other technologies for fulfilling my passion to deliver the greatest reach to customers for software engineers.

Enter the **codemelted.rs** project. The aim of this project is to deliver a swiss army knife module to aid software engineers in building full stack solutions for their applications. Utilizing the Rust programming language, the module serves as a backbone to engineer solutions for multiple build targets. The module serves as a consumable crate for software engineers to build their own custom backend / desktop services applications. Secondly built into the module is a Command Line Interface (CLI) to target script based solutions with a powerful CLI that will work the same regardless of the operating system. Lastly parts of the module along with the `codemelted.js` implementing the `codemelted` namespace will build a WASM / JS consumable modules to build powerful Single / Progressive Web Applications.
