# 1.0 Functional Decomposition

<center><img src="models/all/use-case-model.drawio.png" /></center>

## 1.1 Domain Use Cases

1. **Async:** Asynchronous processing both on a main thread, via background threads, repeating timers, and dedicated workers provides a software engineer the ability to schedule work in a way to run more then one task efficiently.
2. **Console:** Provides a set of STDIN / STDOUT functionality to build an interactive terminal application without a dedicated UI.
3. **DB:** Provides the mechanism for building out an embedded database solution specific to the chosen SDK environment for the language to store complex data structures.
4. **Disk:** Provides the functionality to work with and manage files on a hard disk.
5. **HW:** Provides the mechanisms to interact with hardware peripherals via BLE and RS-232 Serial connected to a system.
6. **JSON:** JSON is the most common data format to work with for web technologies. This will provide all the mechanisms necessary to work with this data.
7. **Logger:** Provides a simple logging facility to log to STDOUT along with hookup a log handler for further processing in production.
8. **Monitor:** Running a dedicated application or service necessitates the ability to monitor the host operating environment. This will establish monitoring capabilities based on the SDK technology.
9. **Network:** The Internet is how apps communicate. This will provide access to web technologies to facilitate this communication.
10. **NPU:**  Stands for Numeric Processing Unit, this will be where all the math is at. Applications need to crunch numbers. This will provide that functionality.
11. **Process:** Provides the interface to interact with host operating system programs as one-off / bi-directional dedicated processes.
12. **Runtime:** Provides the ability to query common properties of the host operating system along with SDK specific hookups for the given runtime.
13. **Storage:** Provides the ability to store data in key / value pairs of strings.
14. **UI:** Identifies the items necessary for the SDK to build either a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or a Terminal User Interface (TUI) to interact with users and provide audio feedback. This establishes UI design goals but is highly tailored to the SDK.

## 1.2 Why Rust?

The `codemelted.rs` module will be an installable crate that provides the full native speed of a C/C++ application but with modern language constructs and memory safety. While C/C++ still have their place in application development, memory safety proves to be the #1 attack vector of hackers. Rust was designed to address those shortcomings and is an ideal choice to address that attack vector. It also provides modern tooling for fully documenting your end product.

Secondly, it allows for the development and targeting of an installable CLI and a consumable JS / WASM module. The combination of all these targets provides a software engineer a singular solution for the entire full stack. From Internet of Things (IoT), applications / services, and PWAs, everything a software engineer needs in one swiss army knife solution ðŸ™‚.

## 1.3 General Design Notes

### 1.3.1 Protocol Handlers

  class CProtocolHandler {
    id() String
    get_message(request String) Result
    is_running() bool
    post_message(T) Result
    terminate()
  }
  class CWorkerProtocol
  class CProcessProtocol
  class CBluetoothDeviceProtocol
  class CSerialPortProtocol
  class CBroadcastChannelProtocol
  class CEventSourceProtocol
  class CWebRTCProtocol
  class CWebSocketProtocol
  CWorkerProtocol --|> CProtocolHandler: implements
  CProcessProtocol --|> CProtocolHandler: implements
  CBluetoothDeviceProtocol --|> CProtocolHandler: implements
  CSerialPortProtocol --|> CProtocolHandler: implements
  CBroadcastChannelProtocol --|> CProtocolHandler: implements
  CEventSourceProtocol --|> CProtocolHandler: implements
  CWebRTCProtocol --|> CProtocolHandler: implements
  CWebSocketProtocol --|> CProtocolHandler: implements
```

The above diagram reflects the basic construct for how protocols will be implemented between the different `codemelted` modules. The `error()` will hold any errors detected with the protocol signaled by either a `post_message() bool` failure or a `get_message() T` where `null` is returned or a detected error is signaled. The `is_running() bool` will reflect the active state of the protocol running and fully connected. Lastly the `terminate()` will close and cleanup any protocol forcing the creation of a new protocol object. These objects will open / connect upon creation via a module function.

### 1.3.2 Module Organization

The `codemelted.rs` module and `codemelted.js` modules will be singular files that implement the identified domain use cases. They will be separated into major section blocks as shown below.

```
// ==================================================
// [ID] =============================================
// ==================================================
```

Function names will identify the domain use case followed by the action being taken. So for instance `logger_log()` is the logger use case logging function. Finally the naming conventions of functions, variables, and classes will follow the naming conventions of the Rust language. That means `snake_case` for functions and parameters and CamelCase for struct / object names.

### 1.3.3 Module Versioning

The versioning of modules will be captured via the languages SDK versioning method. It will utilize a modified semantic versioning `X.Y.Z` with the following rules for the numbering scheme for the module.

- **X:** Year of release. Each new year resets the `Y.Z` values to `1`
- **Y:** Breaking change to one of the use case functions or upgrade of dependencies requiring considerations within an app. A change in this value resets `.Z` to `1`.
- **Z:** Bug fix, new use case function implemented, or expansion of a use case function. Continuously updated by adding one with each new release unless reset by `X.Y` changes.

### 1.3.4 Error Handling

Failed use case functions will result in an indication of failure whether a null return, boolean indicator, or a result object of sorts indicating the failure. Any violation of the module use case function API will result in either a a `panic!` when it comes to `codemelted.rs` or thrown `SyntaxError` for `codemelted.js` indicating what was violated.
